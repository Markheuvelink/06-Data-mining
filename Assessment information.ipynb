    "In the world off football data is becoming more and more common. Because it helps a lot in the business to understand what players strong points are and in which they lack. Data helps them understand that. But it also helps to understand the player. Because at times you see over the years off a player's football life span that they play multiple different positions. \n",
    "\n",
    "But why is the question? Haven't they become good footballers because they are good in the original positions they are scouted in? Well, no, not always. Thats why with data we can see which roll fits a player more. This way we can eliminate the positions changes for a player. This way he can focus on the skills he has and improve them to perfection. This will benefit the club and the players. Because that way they can fully focus on becoming the best in the given position of their traits.\n",

    "The metrics that will be used are for example: shooting power, positioning, defending, standing tackle, sliding tackle, short passes and long passes.

This way you can develop your game around it.\n",

But in FIFA data analysis is used to create to the stats off a player. with these stats we can simulate how it would be if general players were analysed in the same way. Keep in mind keepers will be taken out off the data set because off the completely different aspects that need to be analysed compared to in field players.\n"

As a result, the dataset reduced from ~17,953 to 15,889 entries (goalkeepers excluded). Dropped Irrelevant Columns: Removed metadata like name, birth_date, and financial details (wage_euro) to focus on performance metrics.\n",

    "### 4. Modelling\n",
    "\n",
    "For predicting football players' positions based on their statistics, I chose the k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) algorithm. k-NN is ideal because it classifies players based on the similarity of their performance metrics, such as tackles, and passes. Since player positions are often associated with specific statistical patterns, k-NN can effectively predict a player’s role by comparing them to similar players in the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, k-NN is simple, flexible, and doesn’t make assumptions about the data distribution, making it perfect for this classification task. Its quick setup and ability to adapt to various player styles make it an excellent choice for this problem. \n",
    "\n",
    "To fine-tune the k-NN model, I used GridSearchCV with 5-fold cross-validation. I tested different values for the number of Neighbors (1–20), distance metrics (euclidean and manhattan), and weight strategies (uniform and distance). After evaluating 80 combinations, the best result came from using 20 neighbors, Euclidean distance, and uniform weights.\n",
    "\n",
    "The data was being prepared to use for the modelling. 30% off the data was chosen for testing, 70% will be left over for the model to learn. \n"

    "The k-NN model achieved 97.21% accuracy on the test set, with key metrics including precision (0.9719), recall (0.9650), and F1 score (0.9684). Attackers had precision of 0.97 and recall of 0.96, while Defenders showed precision of 0.97 and recall of 0.98. The confusion matrix revealed 2,038 correct predictions for Attackers and 2,596 for Defenders, with only 133 misclassifications out of 4,767 samples.\n",
    "\n",
    "The model’s interpretability is straightforward, relying on proximity in the feature space, making it easy to understand and explain. Compared to a baseline model, k-NN significantly outperformed in both accuracy and class balance.\n",

    "\n",
    "In the real world the deployment could be more difficult, but it will be possible. First, I need a tool that EA uses to analyse players. I know that exists because the current stats they have on players, and it would be impossible for them to analyse each player 1 by 1. When that’s available I can use the tool from EA to analyse the player based on their stats. This way I can see early on what the best place for the player is.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the future I plan to adjust the data points. Because the football game changes every year or even more. Thats why the qualities necessary for an attacking player and defending player changes over time. So, this needs to be discussed with the trainer using the model. Because they can monitor what they want from attacking or defending player.\n",

    "### Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "The k-NN model achieved a high accuracy of 97.21% in predicting player positions, demonstrating its effectiveness in classifying players as either attackers or defenders based on their performance metrics.  The model's simplicity and interpretability are notable strengths, as it relies on the straightforward concept of proximity in the feature space.    \n",
    "\n",
    "However, the model has limitations, including potential slowness with large datasets and sensitivity to irrelevant or noisy features.  These limitations suggest that careful feature selection and scaling are crucial for optimal performance.    \n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, the project successfully applied the k-NN algorithm to predict player positions with high accuracy.  The insights gained from this project could be valuable for football clubs and analysts in making data-driven decisions about player development and positioning.\n",
    "\n",
    "But in the end I don't think it will be used in the world. Because it there is need for the EA tool to analyze the stats from a player first. Without that it will be impossble to use. \n",
    "\n",
    "Besides this I learned a lot about how the model works and how i can use these kind off models in the future for different kinds off projects."
